# D1. Combat follow-up: close duels, ultimates, and the campaign progression curve

Status: **direction menu**, written 2026-10-23 for future sessions; nothing here is built. It follows
`docs/concepts/combat-system-depth.md` (built and on main at `995fab3`). Start a session with
`/spark resume future-directions-concepts`, or spark one section of this doc as its own idea.

## 1. The owner's words

> "Followup to combat system to resolve close duels mechanisms and balancing of the campaign skill/spell/difficulty progress"

These still bind, from the combat-system-depth spark: builds, not triangles; any school can play any archetype; Agility
has no movement effect while VR is stationary; spell ranks 1-4 add power and rank 5 adds an ultimate form; regular
enemies level once per campaign week; rivals have authored builds.

## 2. Where things stand (measured)

| Area | Today | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Close duels | Brennic (fire_close) semifinal median **15.8 s** against a 45-75 s band, 47% reference wins; air_close 31.8 s | `npm --prefix packages/core run census:builds`; combat-system-depth doc, WP2 section |
| Why they are short | At about 5 m both sides land nearly every blow; extra rival HP raises its win share faster than it lengthens the fight | WP2 report |
| Light builds | fire_light wins all 18 of its fights that end before tier III; air_light gets **no** short fights (Gale Dart 0.9 damage) | builds census |
| Heavy builds | win 55% / 51% of fights reaching tier IV: the curve target is met only narrowly | builds census |
| Ultimates | Third Blade (Shear) rank 5 takes rival wins from 60.5% to **97%**; Brand Drag (Brand Wrath) does nothing measurable, because the heavy AI casts Wrath about 0.5 times per fight | WP3 report, `progression.pc.json` `spellRanks.ultimates` |
| Counters | Air Form answers projectiles reliably; Ring of Cinders is almost never cast (close duels end near its tier II unlock); Tide Ward never fires (it sits at tier II, every beam is tier IV) | WP2 report |
| Campaign progression | Stats train at camp on the 0;6;14;24;36 points curve; **nothing earns Agility or spell ranks yet**; enemy level = campaign week (`season.ts prepareBout`); only weeks 1-2 are playable | `stats.csv`, `season.ts`, `docs/campaign/season-and-time.md` |
| Difficulty by week | Wave 1 clear time 35.3 s (week 1), 44.9 s (week 3), 59.3 s (week 6) at matched agility 1; spell ranks equal to the week bring it back near 36 s | WP1 report |

## 3. Goals

1. A close duel is an **exchange**, not a race: readable trades, a reason to step out and step back in, median in band.
2. Each ultimate makes its archetype **more itself**, within the 40-65% band.
3. The six weeks feel like a **curve the player climbs**: what they earn each week roughly keeps pace with the enemy
   level, and a player who builds well pulls ahead.
4. Every number in this doc's answers comes out of the census, not out of hand-tuning.

## 4. Candidate directions

### 4.1 Close-duel mechanics (pick one or two)

| Option | What changes | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| **A. Exchange windows** (recommended first) | A close hit grants the defender a short punish window: their next close row is faster or their ward re-raises at once. Trades alternate instead of stacking. | New rule in kernel or school code; must stay neutral for Water and the VR parity suites. |
| B. Spacing pressure | Close builds lose Heat/flow when they stay inside 3 m too long; a back-step re-arms them. | Adds a timer the player has to read; needs HUD support (D3). |
| C. Poise and stagger | Close blows build poise damage; a broken guard staggers. Heavy hits trade HP for tempo. | Touches the shared hit path; risk to the Water golden replays. |
| D. Earlier Ring of Cinders | Move Ring's unlock or cost so the counter to close pressure exists inside a close duel. | Data only (overlay), but it changes the canonical numbers VR pins: a VR change request. |
| E. Reference player range | The census reference chases to its own 5-8 m band; let it play its archetype distance, so the census measures real spacing. | Changes every census baseline; re-pin with a reason. |

### 4.2 Ultimates and counters

- **Third Blade**: replace the third projectile with a control effect (a short root or slow on Shear), or keep the blade
  and lower Shear's rank-5 power. Measure both, keep the one inside the band.
- **Brand Drag and the heavy AI**: the heavy plan picks its strongest spell (Pyre). Give the heavy plan a **payoff
  sequence** that spends its tier-IV row when it unlocks, then re-judge Brand Drag.
- **Unused effect kinds**: lingering fire and the Momentum grant are built and tested but unused. Use them in a second
  ultimate pass or delete them.
- **Tide Ward**: either move beam answers to a row Water has early, or give Tide Ward a second answer class.
- **Counter coverage target**: from the ledger, each defensive row answers its shape class in at least N% of the
  contacts it could answer. N is set from the first measurement, not guessed.

### 4.3 Campaign progression curve

| Question | Options |
|---|---|
| How does the player earn **spell ranks**? | (a) points from Games results (renown or a new "insight" currency); (b) camp lessons per school, like focus training at the cistern; (c) both: Games results unlock, camp spends |
| How does the player earn **Agility**? | train at the yard on the shared points curve (as `stats.csv` implies), competing with vigor for yard time |
| How fast? | target: by week N the average spell rank is about N-0.5 for a player who trains steadily, so they sit just under the enemy level and catch up by building well |
| Spellbook growth | new rows join the spellbook by mastery or as Games rewards; the bolt + 4 pick stays |
| Weeks 3-6 | they run headless today; making them playable is shared with D3 |

### 4.4 Difficulty curve and the census

- Add a `--week` sweep to `census:builds` and the default census: each week runs at `enemyLevel = week` with a
  **progression profile** (expected ranks for that week).
- Targets per week: reference win rate and median per wave, with the bands from `arena-tiers.json`.
- A progression profile is data (`progression.pc.json` or a sibling), so the curve can be tuned without code.
- Report the curve as a table: week x wave x archetype -> win rate and median.

## 5. Recommended first slice

1. **Exchange windows (4.1 A)** for close duels, measured on fire_close and air_close plus one far build that should not
   change.
2. **Third Blade rework and the heavy payoff sequence (4.2)**, judged by the builds census.
3. **The week sweep (4.4)** as a reading only, so the progression design (4.3) starts from numbers.

## 6. How success is measured

- Close builds: median inside 45-75 s, reference wins 40-65%, and the hits-per-exchange rate falls.
- Ultimates: every committed rank-5 build stays inside the band and moves its curve signature the right way.
- Counters: each defensive row reaches its coverage target in the ledger.
- Progression: a week-by-week table in which a steadily training player wins 50-65% each week and a player who does not
  train falls below 40% by week 4.
- Unchanged: goldens, default census digests and CR-002/CR-007 parity, unless a slice re-pins them with a reason.

## 7. Open questions for the spark

1. Which close-duel option (A-E) fits the feel the owner wants: trading blows, dancing in and out, or guard breaks?
2. Spell-rank currency: Games results, camp lessons, or both?
3. Should a rank-5 ultimate be rare (one per build) or common late in the season?
4. Do changes to canonical numbers (Ring unlock, Tide Ward) go to VR as change requests, or stay PC overlay deviations?

## 8. Tools to use

`census:builds`, `census:named`, `report:w4`, the threat-answer ledger (`ledger.ts`), the PC overlay
(`school-balance.pc.json`), `progression.pc.json`, `rival-builds.json`, the Lab build pickers, `vr:tuning-return`.
